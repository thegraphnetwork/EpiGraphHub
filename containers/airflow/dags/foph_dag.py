This is an Airflow DAG. This DAG is responsible for running scripts for
collecting data from Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). The API
that fetches the data is available on:
https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/epigraphhub_py/.
A detailed article about the Airflow used in EpiGraphHub can be found
at our website https://www.epigraphhub.org/ or EGH's GitHub Pages:
https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/thegraphnetwork.github.io.

Base Workflow
-------------

             create one task
             for each CSV to
             run in parallel                  ┌────┐   ┌────────────┐
                   │                       ┌─►│load├──►│update_index├─┐
┌───────────────┐  │ ┌────────┐   ┌───────┐│  └────┘   └────────────┘ │  ┌────┐
│csv_relation[n]├──┴►│download├──►│compare├┤                          ├─►│done│
└─────────────┬─┘    └────────┘   └───────┘│               ┌────────┐ │  └────┘
              │                            └──────────────►│continue├─┘
              │                                            └────────┘
              │
       `n` as the number of
       CSV files to download,
       where each one will
       become a task

(Graph generated using https://asciiflow.com/)

Task Summary
------------

start (EmptyOperator) :
    This task does nothing. Used for representing the start of the flow.

down (PythonOperator) :
    This task runs the command for downloading all CSVs found in FOPH URL.

comp (BranchPythonOperator) :
    This branch will decide which task should run next based on the result
    of the evaluation on `compare(tablename, url)`.

same_shape (EmptyOperator) :
    This empty task also does nothing. A task instance is required for
    continuing the flow after the branching.

not_same_shape (EmptyOperator) :
    This empty task also does nothing. A task instance is required for
    continuing the flow after the branching. If the evaluation is False
    the DAG will proceed to update the database.

load (PythonOperator) :
    This task follows `not_same_shape` and updates the database with the
    data from each CSV file with `{...}data.foph.load()`

parse (PythonOperator) :
    Update `geoRegion` and `date` indices if missing in each table.

end (EmptyOperator) :
    This task does nothing. Used for representing that the update flow has
    finish successfully. Marked as success only if all dependencies ran
    successfully.

remove_csv_dir (PythonOperator) :
    This task will remove the FOPH CSV directory recursively.

    This method represents the DAG itself using the @dag decorator. The method
    has to be instantiated so the Scheduler can recognize as a DAG. FOPH DAG
    will be responsible for running data_collection scripts from epigraphhub_py
    api and update the Postgres Database every week.
    As this DAG contains a for loop, every iteration will represent different
    tasks instances. The loop goes through the content found by the method
    `get_csv_relation()` and it is stored in `tables` as a dictionary of URLs
    and table names, each entry will then have their own tasks as defined inside
    the for loop.

    Arguments
    ---------
    Every task will inherit the arguments, using some of them. E.g. retries.

    owner (str)             : The DAG's owner. Only the owner or admin can
                              view or run this DAG.
    depends_on_past (bool)  : If set to True, a task fail will stop
                              further tasks and future DAGs to run until
                              be fixed or manually ran.
    start_date (pendulum)   : When the DAG is ran for the first time.
    email (str)             : Email for failing reports.
    email_on_failure (bool) : If a task fails, an email will be sent.
    email_on_retry (bool)   : An email will be sent every retry attempt.
    retries (int)           : How many times a task should retry if it
                              fails.
    retry_delay (timedelta) : The delay between each retry.
    schedule_interval (str) : The interval between each DAG run. DAG uses
                              CRON syntax too ("* * * * *").
    default_args (dict)     : The same arguments can be passed to
                              different DAGs using default_args.
    catchup (bool)          : If set to True, the DAG will look for past
                              dates to backfill the data if data
                              collection is configured correctly.
                              @warning Not available for FOPH DAG.

    Methods
    -------

                              corresponds the next task to be run.

                              Python Script to connect and update the rows of
                              each table on `tables` into its respective SQL
