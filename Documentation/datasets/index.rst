Datasets available on the EpigraphHub platform
==============================================
Here you will find detailed documentation about the datasets that have been already onboarded to the platform. Each separate dataset is kept in separate `schemas` in our PostgreSQL database.

Schemas can be thought as folders in the database that collect tables from the same source.
