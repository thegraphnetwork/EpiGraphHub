## Development

To create a new environment for EpiGraphHub, you can use it using
conda or docker.

Also, ensure you have the `.env` file with the correct configuration.
You can copy its structure from `.env.tpl`.

### Conda

If you don't have **conda** installed, you can install it from
[here](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#micromamba). Micromamba 
is a miniconda version with mamba, a powerful installer that is much
faster than the conda installer.

Create your new environtment running the following command:

```bash
$ mamba env create -n conda/prod.yaml
```

To activate your new environment with all the packages installed, run:

```bash
$ conda activate epigraphhub
```

### Docker

The project provides three **docker-compose** files, where one is the base
definition (`docker/compose-base.yaml`) and the others are one for 
development (`docker/compose-dev.yaml`) and other for production
(`docker/compose-prod.yaml`). Additionally, there is a **Makefile** 
file that provides `make` targets that helps to manage the docker services:

- `docker-build`: builds docker images
- `docker-start`: starts docker services
- `docker-stop`: stops docker services
- `docker-restart`: restarts docker services
- `docker-logs`: shows docker 
- `docker-dev-prepare-db`: prepares the development version of the database
- `docker-run-cron`: run the cron tasks
- `docker-bash`: opens the docker service bash

This `make` targets runs by default docker for development. For production,
it is necessary to pass the argument `ENV=prod` , for example:

```bash
make docker-build ENV=prod
```

A common workflow to prepare the system would be:

1. Build the docker image:

```bash
$ make docker-build
```

2. Start the services:

```bash
$ make docker-start
```

Before moving forward, check if the services are working properly:

```bash
$ ./docker/healthcheck.sh epigraphhub
```

3. Now, prepare the development database (skip it for production):

```bash
$ make docker-prepare-db
```

## Deployment

The deployment is executed by **Ansible** and trigger by **GitHub Actions**.
When a new release is triggered, on **GitHub Actions**, there is a step
there that uses **Ansible** to connect to the **EpiGraphHub** server
and deploy the new version.

NOTE: Currently, the deployment process is under development.

The deployment is designed in the following structure:

![deployment-graphic](images/deployment.png)

All the services are being migrated to docker containers. It will allows us 
to isolate the services and keep the host server safer.
