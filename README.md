<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/140123/165057109-f09d6e8d-6ca2-405f-b912-7e068f20e39a.png)
EpigraphHub is an entirely open source Data integration platform focused on Epidemiological analyses.



### Built With

EpigraphHub is built on top of the industry-leading opensource BI platform [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org) enriched by our own analytical libraries in Python and R.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get a feel of EpigraphHub as a user, please check it out at
**[Epigraphhub.org](https://epigraphhub.org)**.


### Prerequisites

As the project uses podman, ensure you are able to use that in your
operation system.

For debian based architecture, you will need to install the following
dependencies:


* `libvshadow-utils`


For more information, check the [official documentation](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)

### Installation

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/thegraphnetwork/GRAPHnetEpiApp/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

Check our wiki for complementary informations



<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
Contact us to get involved in the project and join our team on discord

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/ProposedFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some ProposedFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/ProposedFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Development

To create a new environment for EpiGraphHub, you can use it using
conda or docker.

Also, ensure you have the `.env` file with the correct configuration.
You can copy its structure from `.env.tpl`.

### Conda

If you don't have **conda** installed, you can install it from
[here](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#micromamba). Micromamba
is a miniconda version with mamba, a powerful installer that is much
faster than the conda installer.

Create your new environtment running the following command:

```bash
$ mamba env create -n conda/prod.yaml
```

To activate your new environment with all the packages installed, run:

```bash
$ conda activate epigraphhub
```

### Containers

![fig2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/140123/165057193-c5a2b2a2-8f30-426d-9bac-8f559c01265d.png)


The project provides three **compose** files, where one is the base
definition (`containers/compose-base.yaml`) and the others are one for
development (`containers/compose-dev.yaml`) and other for production
(`containers/compose-prod.yaml`). Additionally, there is a **Makefile**
file that provides `make` targets that helps to manage the docker services:

- `containers-build`: builds docker images
- `containers-start`: starts docker services
- `containers-stop`: stops docker services
- `containers-restart`: restarts docker services
- `containers-logs`: shows docker
- `containers-dev-prepare-db`: prepares the development version of the database
- `containers-run-cron`: run the cron tasks
- `containers-bash`: opens the docker service bash

This `make` targets runs by default docker for development. For production,
it is necessary to pass the argument `ENV=prod` , for example:

```bash
make containers-build
```

A common workflow to prepare the system would be:

1. Build the docker image:

```bash
$ make containers-build
```

2. Start the services:

```bash
$ make containers-start
```

Before moving forward, check if the services are working properly:

```bash
$ ./containers/healthcheck.sh epigraphhub
```

3. Now, prepare the development database (skip it for production):

```bash
$ make containers-prepare-db
```

## AIRFLOW

Create a **FERNET KEY**:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Deployment

The deployment is executed by **Ansible** and triggered by **GitHub Actions**.
When a new release is triggered, on **GitHub Actions**, there is a step
there that uses **Ansible** to connect to the **EpiGraphHub** server
and deploy the new version.

NOTE: Currently, the deployment process is under development.

The deployment is designed in the following structure:

![deployment-graphic](images/deployment.png)

All the services are being migrated to docker containers. It will allows us
to isolate the services and keep the host server safer.
